The GME short squeeze of January 2021 is one of the most poignant cases of short squeezing due to the organisation of it through non-institutional investors (Vasileiou et al., 2021). 
There has been a large volume of work investigating the trends and actions of the assets subject to the short squeeze, but little has been investigated to analyse the long-term effects of herding on the assets targeted. 
The effect of the GME short squeeze have been shown to have changed the perception of the retail investor’s market speculation and thus behaviour (Klein, 2021). The long-lasting effects of investor behaviour for stocks after the initial period of mass action and hysteria could prove useful for informing investments following a period of similar circumstances. 
In this assignment, the stock prices of the targeted stocks of the short squeeze are analysed for potential herding behaviour for the period of the squeeze itself, January 2021, through to January 2023. An intuitive assumption is that the key influence on the stock prices was due to herding behaviour. The targeting of “meme stocks” for retail investors was due to information shared communally through social media platforms such as reddit’s r/wallstreetbets forum. This is best reflected in the tagline for the movement: “Apes together Strong”, typifying the large number of individual investors influenced by social and informational cues who then acted on these in a coordinated manner.
